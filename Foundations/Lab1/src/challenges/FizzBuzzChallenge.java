 * Note:
 * 1. Nested If are considered bad practices?
 * 2. This is not terribly bad—the more we nest the more confusing the code become—to other people
 * 3. The more we build the more we realize that there is no way to build ideal software
 * 4. Programming and problem-solving always a trade-offs
 * 5. Every solution has a degree of strength, and weakness
 * 6. Not having repetition but duplication??
 * 7. But having nested structure that make the code had and read and understand would be really ideal?
