     * Annual Interest Rate: 3.92 will be devided by 100 then /12
     * Period(Years)- 30 to be * 12 – number of payments

        // Next Challenge: when codes start getting too long, it hurts the maintainability!
        //We need to convert the code into smaller and easier chunks using OOP.
        //Build On This Mortgage Calculator To Enhance The Code Using OOP Best Practices And SOLID Principles
